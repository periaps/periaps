Fluidity Space Services was founded by [Tyler Schell](_team/tyler-schell.md) and [Noah Gula](_team/noah-gula.md) to address challenges faced by the aerospace and automotive industries. In particular, Tyler and Noah identified a lack of manufacturing readiness to support both state-of-the-art technology programs with little or no heritage, as well as immature support infrastructure for the demanding automotive manufacturing environment. In response, Tyler and Noah teamed up to support America's forefront industries and offer their expertise.

We support our clients in all facets of product commercialization, from requirements definition and design qualification, to manufacturing process development. Specifically, our expertise is in advanced propulsion technologies, on-orbit servicing, assembly, and manufacturing, design for advanced manufacturing, and process development.

Our services are are frictionless and designed to seamlessly integrate with our clients' workflow. By focussing our efforts on your pain points, we identify and alleviate roadblocks so you can focus on your products and expertise. We have adopted New Space's philosophy of failing fast and learning fast by making every effort to build prototypes, test hypotheses, and iterate solutions as quickly as possible. But, never making the same mistake twice.
